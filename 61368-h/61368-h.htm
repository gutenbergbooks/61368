  "HOW SHALL WE RISE TO GREET THE DAWN?"<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  How shall we rise to greet the dawn?<br />
  Not timidly,<br />
  With a hand above our eyes,<br />
  But greet the strong light<br />
  Joyfully;<br />
  Nor will we mistake the dawn<br />
  For the mid-day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We must create and fashion a new God&mdash;<br />
  A God of power, of beauty, and of strength&mdash;<br />
  Created painfully, cruelly,<br />
  Labouring from the revulsion of men's minds.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It is not that the money-changers<br />
  Ply their trade<br />
  Within the sacred places;<br />
  But that the old God<br />
  Has made the Stock Exchange his Temple.<br />
  We must drive him from it.<br />
  Why should we tinker with clay feet?<br />
  We will fashion<br />
  A perfect unity<br />
  Of precious metals.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Let us tear the paper moon<br />
  From its empty dome.<br />
  Let us see the world with young eyes.<br />
  Let us harness the waves to make power,<br />
  And in so doing,<br />
  Seek not to spoil their rolling freedom,<br />
  But to endow<br />
  The soiled and straining cities<br />
  With the same splendour of strength.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We will not be afraid,<br />
  Tho' the golden geese cackle in the Capitol,<br />
  In fear<br />
  That their eggs may be placed<br />
  In an incubator.<br />
  Continually they cackle thus&mdash;<br />
  These venerable birds&mdash;<br />
  Crying, "Those whom the Gods love<br />
  Die young,"<br />
  Or something of that sort.<br />
  But we will see that they live<br />
  And prosper.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Let us prune the tree of language<br />
  Of its dead fruit.<br />
  Let us melt up the clich√©s<br />
  Into molten metal;<br />
  Fashion weapons that will scald and flay;<br />
  Let us curb this eternal humour<br />
  And become witty.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Let us dig up the dragon's teeth<br />
  From this fertile soil;<br />
  Swiftly,<br />
  Before they fructify;<br />
  Let us give them as medicine<br />
  To the writhing monster itself.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We must create and fashion a new God&mdash;<br />
  A God of power, of beauty, and of strength;<br />
  Created painfully, cruelly,<br />
  Labouring from the revulsion of men's minds.<br />
  Cast down the idols of a thousand years,<br />
  Crush them to dust<br />
  Beneath the dancing rhythm of our feet.<br />
  Oh! let us dance upon the weak and cruel:<br />
  We must create and fashion a new God.<br />

  PRELUDE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  We have wandered through the dim valleys of sleep<br />
  &mdash;That lie so still and far&mdash;<br />
  Have bathed in the lakes of silence,<br />
  Where each star<br />
  Shines brighter than its own reflection in the heavens;<br />
  Where, diving deep,<br />
  My soul has sought to catch and keep<br />
  The silver feathers of the moon<br />
  That float like down upon the waters,<br />
  In whose pale rest<br />
  We find<br />
  Forgetfulness of death<br />
  That comes so soon<br />
  &mdash;Waters that lull the mind<br />
  With some sweet breath<br />
  Of wind, of flowers,<br />
  With summer showers of rain,<br />
  Or quicken it with recreative pain.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We have fled further from this leaden cage,<br />
  Seeking those rainbow forests,<br />
  Where the light<br />
  Thrills through you, shaking, fainting, with delight;<br />
  Where sway tall luminous trees<br />
  Wind-swept in one vast flashing harmony,<br />
  That like a wave<br />
  Splashes its seething sound<br />
  And then envelops you.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We have strayed to other places,<br />
  Courts of fear,<br />
  That stretch like echoes through the endless dusk<br />
  Drenched with dead memories;<br />
  Like musk<br />
  They cling about you<br />
  In a heavy cloud.<br />
  Each shadow-sound we hear<br />
  Clutches the heart.<br />
  With fevered hands we tear<br />
  The terror-pulsing walls<br />
  &mdash;Fight our way out<br />
  &mdash;Out<br />
  Into other Courts<br />
  As vague and full of fear.<br />
  And we have found the proud and distant palaces of night.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
<a id="silence"></a>
  THE SILENCE OF GOD<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  One night upon the southern sea<br />
  In helpless calm we lay,<br />
  Waiting for day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  As goldripe fruit fall from a tree<br />
  A comet fell; no other sight,<br />
  But in the ocean tracks of light<br />
  Trembled&mdash;then passed away,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No sound broke on our waiting ears,<br />
  Though instinct whispered wayward fears<br />
  Of things we cannot tell&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of things the sea could tell.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No wisp of wind, no watery sound<br />
  Reached us; as if high on the ground<br />
  We stayed.  A sense of fever fell<br />
  Upon each mind,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each soul and mind.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Until our eyes, that ever sought<br />
  The cloying empty darkness, find<br />
  Another shape&mdash;or is it wrought<br />
  Of terror?&mdash;on the deep<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless deep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All dark it lay.  No light shone out;<br />
  And though we cried across, no shout<br />
  Came back to us.  As if in sleep<br />
  The black bulk lay so still,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So still.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No sign came back; no answering cry<br />
  Cleft the immense monotony<br />
  That swathed us like a funeral pall,<br />
  In folds of menace; almost shrill<br />
  The silence seemed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we so small.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Swiftly a boat was lowered down;<br />
  The rowlocks creaked; our track shone white<br />
  Behind us like God's frown,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's frown.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We clambered up that great ship's height;<br />
  There was no light; there was no sound;<br />
  Nor was there any being found<br />
  Upon that ship,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ship.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We groped our way along.  God knows<br />
  How long the rats had been alone<br />
  With dust and rust!  Yet flight was shown<br />
  To have been instant, in the grip<br />
  Of some force stronger than its foes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Its human foes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then sudden from the dark there thrilled<br />
  The distant dying of a song<br />
  That hung like haze upon the sea, and filled<br />
  Each soul with joy and terror strong,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy and terror strong.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Upon the sombre air were spent<br />
  These notes, as from a hidden place<br />
  Where all time and all love lay pent<br />
  In lingering embrace&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lingering embrace.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Deep in our hearts we felt the call;<br />
  We knew that if our fate should send<br />
  That song again, we must leave all<br />
  And follow to the end,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end.<br />
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<a id="adventure"></a>
  ADVENTURE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Down through the torrid seas we swept,<br />
  Sails curved like bows about to shoot.<br />
  As an arrow speeds through the air<br />
  Our ship parted the clinging waters.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then, out of the ocean<br />
  Blossomed a distant land.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The air quivered,<br />
  Dancing above it<br />
  In a frenzy of passion.<br />
  Waves of heat trembled towards us<br />
  Across the cool lassitude of the ocean.<br />
  They rolled new odours at us,<br />
  Sounding the chords of hidden senses,<br />
  Till we were alert<br />
  With minds as sensitive and taut<br />
  As resined strings.<br />
  The sea itself<br />
  Crouched down behind us,<br />
  Urging us on,<br />
  Driving us on,<br />
  To unknown<br />
  Perilous adventures.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  * * * * *<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Ships and sea were forgotten.<br />
  We trampled<br />
  And stumbled<br />
  On, on,<br />
  Through the burning sand<br />
  To the hot shroud of the squat threatening forest,<br />
  Where, as you walked,<br />
  You tore apart<br />
  A solid sheet of air.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Brown satyrs grimaced at us,<br />
  Swinging with long hairy arms<br />
  From crooked branch to crooked branch.<br />
  The sun<br />
  Was at its height.<br />
  Rays pierced the hot shade;<br />
  White lines of light<br />
  Shot through the shadows<br />
  To where a point of green<br />
  Shuddered with dangerous movement,<br />
  Throbbed and hummed with the whirr of insects.<br />
  Birds more bright than any streamers from the sun<br />
  Cleft the air<br />
  Like hammers;<br />
  Scintillating wings<br />
  Tossed patches of colour<br />
  Into the dark shimmering air.<br />
  Shrill calls<br />
  Whistled like knives<br />
  Hurled through the empty heat.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Frantic chattering rose up.<br />
  Through the honeycombed darkness<br />
  Slim animals<br />
  &mdash;Their hides splashed with false sunlight&mdash;<br />
  Quivered away<br />
  Into the hollow distance.<br />
  Or clattered past us,<br />
  Cloven hooves<br />
  Kicking at the hard, bent trunks<br />
  Of gnarled trees.<br />
  Large hairy fruits of wood<br />
  Were cast at us,<br />
  Snarlingly,<br />
  From the darkness.<br />
  Faces<br />
  &mdash;Faces peered down<br />
  From the interwoven boughs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Hastily we stumbled on;<br />
  Hurriedly we stumbled back,<br />
  Bewildered.<br />
  Small tracks<br />
  Tripped through the blackness<br />
  Hither and thither;<br />
  Twigs crawled from under our feet,<br />
  Hissing away<br />
  In venom<br />
  &mdash;And we were bewildered.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then suddenly<br />
  We felt,<br />
  Rumbling in curling patterns through the ground,<br />
  The beating of drums.<br />
  As winds bellow into caves,<br />
  As waves swirl and curl into hollows,<br />
  We heard the blowing of wooden trumpets<br />
  And of pipes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Soon,<br />
  Under the western canopy of the sun,<br />
  Where the fevered hills lay huddled together,<br />
  We saw great gourd-shaped palaces<br />
  Loom up like mountains.<br />
  Figures played on trumpets,<br />
  Twisted like snakes,<br />
  Or on the curved, carved horns of unknown beasts.<br />
  In the sound was mirrored<br />
  The panic seizures of the night,<br />
  &mdash;The fear of things that walk in darkness.<br />
  The drums were painted<br />
  In hot colours<br />
  That, even through the dusk,<br />
  Glowed torture and writhing torment.<br />
  Like a shower of molten lead<br />
  The din fell down upon us<br />
  From the Palaces.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Bare yellow women<br />
  Hurried<br />
  To greet us;<br />
  Their heels swayed inward<br />
  As they walked.<br />
  They offered fruits<br />
  &mdash;Fruits that were strange to us;<br />
  Mellow they were, and with a scent<br />
  Of sun, of summer,<br />
  And of woodland nights.<br />
  We ate<br />
  &mdash;And dreams closed round.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Night like a hawk<br />
  Swooped down<br />
  On to the phoenix bird,<br />
  &mdash;Tore out its flaming feathers.<br />
  Solitary plumes<br />
  Flared down into the darkness,<br />
  Floating above the distant sea.<br />
  Stillness and heat clung together;<br />
  And the hawk<br />
  Spread out her wings.<br />

  SAILOR-SONG<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  On swinging seas our ship has flown<br />
  &mdash;In sun and shadow lands alit.<br />
  We saw the sack of Carthage Town<br />
  (And Dido building it).<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Cassandra, direful prophetess,<br />
  We heard foretell the fate of Troy,<br />

  That wooden, painted toy.<br />

  We've seen events aboard this hulk<br />
  Of grave import and mystery<br />

<p class="poem">
  Then once we left Atlantis Town.<br />
  Behind us like a lily flower<br />
  It blossomed; but then down, far down,<br />
  Sank every vane and tower.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Now you can hear the clanging beat<br />

  The rocking earth<br />

  About to fight.<br />
  Trees roll beckoning branches at us,<br />
  Branches that swing and sway.<br />
  From the forest<br />
  The animals<br />
  Howl<br />

<p class="poem">
  Why should a sailor ride the sea,<br />
  When he can drink and dance and sing,<br />
  Or watch the stars out-blossoming<br />
  Upon the tree of night?<br />

  CORNUCOPIA<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Now music fills the night with moving shades;<br />
  Its velvet darkness, veined like a grape,<br />
  Obscures and falls round many a subtle shape<br />
  &mdash;Figures that steal through cool tall colonnades,<br />
  Vast minotaurian corridors of sleep;<br />
  Rhythmic they pass us, splashed by red cascades<br />
  Of wine, fierce-flashing fountains whose proud waves<br />
  Shimmer awhile; plunge foaming over steep<br />
  Age-polished rocks, into the dim cold caves<br />
  Of starlit dusk below&mdash;then merge with night,<br />
  Softly as children sinking into sleep.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But now more figures sway into our sight;<br />
  Strong and bare-shouldered, pressed and laden down,<br />
  Stagger across the terraces.  They bear<br />
  Great Cornucopia of summer fruit<br />
  And heavy roses scented with the noon<br />
  &mdash;Piled up with fruit and blossoms, all full blown,<br />
  Crimson, or golden as the harvest moon&mdash;<br />
  Piled up and overflowing in a flood<br />
  Of riches; brilliant-plumaged birds, that sing<br />
  As the faint playing on a far sweet lute,<br />
  Warble their tales of conquest and of love;<br />
  Perch on each shoulder; sweep each rainbow wing<br />
  Like light'ning through the breathless dark above.<br />
  Heaped up in vases gems shine hard and bright;<br />
  Sudden they flare out&mdash;gleaming red like blood&mdash;<br />
  For now the darkness turns to swelling light,<br />
  Great torches gild each shadow, tear the sky,<br />
  As drums tear through the silence of the night;<br />
  Breaking its crystal quiet&mdash;making us cry<br />
  Or catch our sobbing breath in sudden fear.<br />
  A shadow stumbles, and the jewels shower<br />
  On to the pavers with a sharp sweet sound.<br />
  They mingle with the fountain drops that flower<br />
  Up in a scarlet bloom above the ground,<br />
  A beauteous changing blossom; then they rain<br />
  On to the broad mysterious terraces,<br />
  Where sea-gods rise to watch in cold disdain<br />
  Before those vast vermillion palaces,<br />
  &mdash;Watch where the slumbering coral gods of noon,<br />
  Drunk with the sudden golden light and flare<br />
  Of flaming torches, try to pluck and tear<br />
  That wan enchanted lotus flower, the moon,<br />
  Down from its calm still waters; thus they fall,<br />
  Like flowing plumes, the fountains of our festival.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Slowly the torches die.  They echo long,<br />
  These last notes of a Bacchanalian song,<br />
  Of drifting drowsy beauty, born of sleep,<br />
  &mdash;Vast as the sea, as changing and as deep.<br />
  In thanksgiving for shelt'ring summer skies<br />
  Still, far away, a fervent red light glows.<br />
  Small winds brush past against our lips and eyes,<br />
  Caress them like a laughing summer rose,<br />
  And rainbow moths flit by, in circling flight.<br />
  A harp sobs out its crystal syruppings;<br />
  Faintly it sounds, as the poor petal-wings,<br />
  Fragile yet radiant, of a butterfly<br />
  Beating against the barriers of night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then from the Ocean came the Syren song,<br />
  Heavy with perfume, yet faint as a sigh,<br />
  Kissing our minds, and changing right from wrong;<br />
  Chaining our limbs; making our bodies seem<br />
  Inert and spellbound, dead as in a dream.<br />

  Bound by the silver fetters of your voice<br />
  To this new slavery of dreams,<br />
  We, listening, rejoice.<br />
  The magic strains<br />
  Swell in this darkness star-devoid.<br />
  The music streams<br />
  Upon the world in patterns passionate yet clear,<br />
  And stains<br />
  Each soul.  The mind, decoyed<br />
  By thoughts that grind and tear<br />
  Away old values,<br />
  Is sent down other thoughts<br />
  So subtly swift,<br />
  That in their fleeting passage<br />
  They can cut adrift our souls<br />
  Upon a sea of wonder and of fear.<br />
  Within the arid minds of men<br />
  This music sounds but once, for then<br />
  They hear no other song.<br />
  In it, tumultuous rush of wings,<br />
  The glamour of old lovely things<br />
  In deserts buried long,<br />
  The grace of beasts that bound and leap<br />
  With movements blithe and strong<br />
  &mdash;Of those that creep<br />
  Away in hissing-reptile rage&mdash;<br />
  All these, all these are found.<br />
  They hear<br />
  The secrets, solved, of each dead age,<br />
  Each mystery is clear.<br />
  For in this music's flow, the din<br />
  Of spheres that tear and speed and spin<br />
  Through pulsing space is heard,<br />
  And all things men have loved and feared<br />
  Are mirror'd in each sound.<br />

  SONG<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Our hidden voices, wreathed with love's soft flowers,<br />
  Wind-toss'd thro' valleys, tremble across seas<br />
  To turbann'd cities; touch tall lonely towers,<br />
  Call to you thro' the sky, the wind, the trees.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Misted and golden as the hanging moon,<br />
  That like a summer fruit floats from the sky,<br />
  Thrills out our distant age-enchanted tune,<br />
  &mdash;Nor will it let you pass our beauty by.<br />
  But if it should not reach to stir your mind,<br />
  Then hold a summer rose against the ear,<br />
  Till through its crimson sweetness you can hear<br />
  The falling flow of rhythm&mdash;so designed<br />
  That from this secret island, like a star<br />
  Shining above a shrouded world, our song<br />
  Cleaves through the darkest night and echoes long,<br />
  Bidding you follow whether near or far.<br />
  Come hither where the mermaids churn the foam,<br />
  Lashing their tails across the calm, or dive<br />
  To groves and gardens of bright flowers; then roam<br />
  Beneath the shade of stone-branched trees, or drive<br />
  Some slow sea-monster to its musselled home.<br />
  Here, as a ladder, they climb up and down<br />
  The rainbow's steep refracted steps of light,<br />
  Till, when the dusk sends down its rippling frown,<br />
  They quiver back to us in silver flight.<br />
  The moon sails down once more; our mermaids bring<br />
  Rich gifts of ocean fruit.  Again we sing.<br />
  Enchantment, love, vague fear, and memories<br />
  That cling about us like the fumes of wine<br />
  With myriad love-enhancing mysteries<br />
  We pour out in one song&mdash;intense&mdash;divine,<br />
  Down the deep moonlit chasms of the waves<br />
  Our song floats on the opiate breeze.  Why seek<br />
  To goad your carven galleys, fast-bound slaves<br />
  Who search each sweeping line of bay and creek,<br />
  Only to stagger on a hidden rock, or find<br />
  The limp dead sails swept off by sudden wind?<br />
  Thus always you must search the cruel sea,<br />
  For if you find us mankind shall be free!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But when you sleep we grasp you by the hand,<br />
  And to the trickling honey of the flute<br />
  We lead you to a distant shimmering land<br />
  Where lotus-eaters munch their golden fruit,<br />
  Then fall upon the fields of summer flowers<br />
  In drunken sunlit slumber, while a fawn<br />
  Prances and dances round them.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, those hours<br />
  When through the crystal valleys of the dawn<br />
  Down from the haunted forests of the night<br />
  There dash the dew-drenched centaurs on their way,<br />
  Mad with the sudden rush of golden light<br />
  &mdash;Affright the lotus-eaters, as they sway<br />
  Towards the woodlands in a stumbling flight.<br />
  In these deep groves we follow through the cool<br />
  Shadow of high columnar trees, to find<br />
  The fallen sky within a forest pool<br />
  That's faintly veiled and fretted by a wind,<br />
  Lest our white flashing limbs should turn you blind.<br />

  In watery circles on the verge of night,<br />
  So rounded ripples spread beneath the shade<br />
  Of flowing branches dripping with green light.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thus do we wander; but when day is spent<br />
  We grope our way thro' vast tall palaces,<br />
  Palaces sinister and somnolent,<br />
  Where lurk dim fears and unknown menaces.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  These high pale walls and this pale shining floor<br />
  Seem built of bones, by ages planed and ground<br />
  To a white smoothness.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this rock-bound shore<br />
  The bodies of dead sailors oft are found.<br />

  These sombre arches pierce the sullen sky.<br />

<p class="poem">
  These pillars are the pillars of the night.<br />

  Our music chains you: binds your limbs from flight.<br />

  PROSPECT ROAD<br />

<p class="poem">
  Gigantic houses, tattered by all time,<br />
  Raise their immense and ruined bulk and height<br />
  In one unending universal street,<br />
  Against a strange and sunken yellow sky<br />
  &mdash;Like sunset trickling through into the sea,<br />
  Down to the depths&mdash;yellow and grey and green.<br />
  Blind windows face the interminable road;<br />
  Innumerable those windows seem to stretch<br />
  All smeared and stained and stamped with time and blood,<br />
  &mdash;Stains that seem faces&mdash;horrid twitching masks<br />
  Moving their lewd derisive lips and tongues,<br />
  Spitting out treacheries with vampire lips&mdash;<br />
  Or eyes that gaze from far blank-stretching walls<br />
  &mdash;The tortured eyes of those who see their death<br />
  Approaching √¶on-by-√¶on along this road.<br />
  Behind the walls sound voices whispering<br />
  Of dire and hidden, carefully hidden, thoughts&mdash;<br />
  Cruel, wicked and unfathomable things<br />
  That lie behind this infamy of stone.<br />
  Then clamour, shrieking voices, or a pause<br />
  That falls like lead through the suspended air;<br />
  Broken by laughter&mdash;rending piercing sounds<br />
  That seem to tear the fabric of our minds.<br />
  Slinking along these wicked, stricken walls,<br />
  I reached a shining distant point of light.<br />
  And glory came&mdash;vast and unending light,<br />
  Rays&mdash;flashing, writhing rays of light.<br />
  And then the music sounded.  Ah, that sound!<br />

  "God and eternity"&mdash;strange flashing sounds<br />
  The whirl of time, "Melchisedec"&mdash;"Glory of God"<br />
  And space&mdash;the universe&mdash;like framing words&mdash;<br />

<p class="poem">
  At the house of Mrs. Kinfoot<br />
  Are collected<br />
  Men and women<br />
  Of all ages.<br />
  They are supposed<br />
  To sing, paint, or to play the piano.<br />
  In the drawing-room<br />
  The fireplace is set<br />
  With green tiles<br />
  Of an acanthus pattern.<br />
  The black curls of Mrs. Kinfoot<br />
  Are symmetrical.<br />
  &mdash;Descended, it is said,<br />
  From the Kings of Ethiopia&mdash;<br />
  But the British bourgeoisie has triumphed.<br />
  Mr. Kinfoot is bald<br />
  And talks<br />
  In front of the fireplace<br />
  With his head on one side,<br />
  And his right hand<br />
  In his pocket.<br />
  The joy of catching tame elephants,<br />
  And finding them to be white ones,<br />
  Still gleams from the jungle-eyes<br />
  Of Mrs. Kinfoot,<br />
  But her mind is no jungle<br />
  Of Ethiopia,<br />
  But a sound British meadow.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Listen then to the gospel of Mrs. Kinfoot:<br />

  Cain was such a man of the world<br />
  And belonged to every club in London;<br />
  His father simply adored him,<br />
  &mdash;But had never really liked Abel,<br />
  Who was rather a milk-sop.<br />
  Nothing exists which the British bourgeoisie<br />
  Does not understand;<br />
  Therefore there is no death<br />

  The valleys that were known in sunlit hours<br />
  Are vast and vague as seas;<br />
  Wan as the blackthorn flowers<br />
  That quiver in the first spring-scented breeze:<br />
  Far as the frosted hollows of the moon.<br />
  The sighing woods are still&mdash;<br />
  Wrapp'd in their age-long boon<br />
  Of mystery and sleep.  A naked hill,<br />
  Loud and discordant, looms against the sky,<br />
  And little lights like stars<br />
  Break the monotony<br />
  Of blue and silver, black and grey.  Strange bars<br />
  Of light resemble silver masks, and leer<br />
  Across the forest lane.<br />
  Tall nettles, rank from rain,<br />
  Scent all the woods with some ancestral fear.<br />

  THE LAMENT OF THE MOLE-CATCHER<br />

<p class="poem">
  An old, sad man who catches moles<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went lonely down the lane&mdash;<br />
  All lily-green were the lanes and knolls,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sorrow numbed his brain.<br />
  He paid no heed to flower or weed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he went his lonely way.<br />
  No note he heard from any bird<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sang, that sad spring day.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I trap'd the moles for forty years<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who could not see the sky,<br />
  I reckoned not blind blood or tears,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord has seen them die.<br />
  For forty years I've sought to slay<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small, the dumb, the blind,<br />
  But now the Lord has made me pay,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am like their kind.<br />
  I cannot see or lane or hill,<br />

  THE BEGINNING<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Great spheres of fire, to which the sun is nought,<br />
  Pass thund'ring round our world.  A golden mist&mdash;<br />
  The margin to the universe&mdash;falls round<br />
  The verges of our vision.  Rocks ablaze<br />
  Leap upward to the sun, or fall beneath<br />
  The rush of our rapidity, that seems<br />
  Catastrophy, and not the joyous birth<br />
  Of yet another star.  The air is full<br />
  Of clashing colour, full of sights and sounds<br />
  Too plain and loud for men to heed or hear,<br />
  The cosmic cries of pain that follow birth:<br />
  A multi-coloured world.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scorching heat<br />
  Surpasses all the equatorial days:<br />
  Steam rises from the surface of the sea.<br />
  Gigantic rainbow mists resemble forms<br />
  That bring to mind strange elemental sprites<br />
  Exulting in the chaos of creation.<br />
  They glide above the tumult-ridden sea<br />
  Which now is shaken as are autumn leaves;<br />
  Great hollows open and reveal its depths&mdash;<br />
  Devoid of any form of life or death.<br />
  Till wave on wave it gathers strength again<br />
  And shakes a mountain, splits it to the base<br />
  (Still weak from struggle as a new-born babe).<br />
  Then night comes on, and shows the flaming path<br />
  Of all the rocks that vainly seek the sun.<br />
  Broad as the arch of space, a myriad moons<br />
  Sail slowly by the sea; the glowing world<br />
  Shows up the pallor of their ivory.<br />
  The din grows greater from the universe:<br />
  There rises up the smell of fire and iron,&mdash;<br />
  Not dreary like the smell of burnt-out things,<br />
  But like the smell of some gigantic forge&mdash;<br />
  Cheerful, of good intent, and full of life.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now all the joyous cries of sea and earth,<br />
  The universal harmonies of birth,<br />
  Rise up to haunt the slumber of their God.<br />

  THE END<br />

  Round the great ruins crawl those things of slime<br />
  Green ruins lichenous and scarred by moss&mdash;<br />
  An evil lichen that proclaims world doom,<br />
  Like blood dried brown upon a dead man's face.<br />
  And nothing moves save those monstrosities,<br />
  Armoured and grey, and of a monster size.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But now, a thing passed through the cloying air<br />
  With flap and clatter of its scaly wings&mdash;<br />
  As if the whole world echoed from some storm.<br />
  One scarce could see it in the dim green light<br />
  Till suddenly it swooped and made a dart<br />
  And brushed away one of those things of slime,<br />
  Just as a hawk might sweep upon its prey.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It seems as if the light grows dimmer yet&mdash;<br />
  No radiance from the dreadful green above,<br />
  Only a lustrous light or iridescence<br />
  As if from off a carrion-fly,&mdash;surrounds<br />
  That vegetation which is never touched<br />
  By any breeze.  The air is thick, and brings<br />
  The tainted subtle sweetness of decay.<br />
  Where, yonder, lies the noisome river-course,<br />
  There shows a faintly phosphorescent glow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Long writhing bodies fall and twist and rise,<br />
  And one can hear them playing in the mud.<br />
  Upon the ruined walls there gleam and shine<br />
  The track of those grey vast monstrosities&mdash;<br />
  As some gigantic snail had crawled along.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All round the shining bushes waver lines<br />
  Suggesting shadows, slight and grey, but full<br />
  Of that which makes one nigh to dead with fear.<br />

  When the woods are white beneath the moon<br />
  And grass is wet with crystal dew,<br />
  When in the pool<br />
  So clear and cool<br />
  The moon reflects itself anew,<br />
  We raise ourselves from daylight's swoon,<br />
  We shake away<br />
  The sleep of day,<br />
  Out from our bosky homes we spring;<br />
  Horns wreathed with flowers,<br />
  Throughout the hours<br />
  Of moonlight, worshipping we sing.<br />
  Pale iv'ry goddess, whose wan light<br />
  Looks down upon us worshipping&mdash;<br />
  Each dappled faun<br />
  Who shuns the dawn,<br />
  Is here, and rarest gifts we bring&mdash;<br />
  The feathers of the birds of night<br />
  Wrought to a crown<br />
  Of softest down<br />
  We offer you, and crystal bright,<br />
  The dew within a lily cup<br />
  Reflecting stars<br />
  In shining bars;<br />
  All things most strange we offer up&mdash;<br />
  Rich gifts of fruit and honeyed flowers<br />
  To place within your secret bowers.<br />
  We shake down apples from the trees,<br />
  And pears, and plums with velvet skin;<br />
  Up to the sky<br />
  We cast these high<br />
  And pray you'll stoop to net them in.<br />
  We dance: then fall upon our knees<br />
  And pray and sing&mdash;all this to show<br />
  The love that all loyal fauns must owe<br />
  To you, white goddess of the night.<br />

  The faun runs through the forest of the noon,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then leaps into some lovely shrouded glade<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splashed with hot light.  He dances in the shade<br />
  Of tower-like trees, whose branches sway and swoon<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath their weight of green.  No breath of air<br />
  Ruffles the vivid blossom or the moss<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which he pirouettes, all is so fair!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He leaps about; then, tired and at a loss<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what to do, he roams the wood&mdash;espies<br />
  A figure like himself&mdash;but stiff and grey!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lacking the hairy chest and dappled thighs<br />
  That are his pride.  "But surely this can play<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scamper, dance and snuffle through the day<br />
  As well as me?"  So he comes near and eyes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lichened features of a faun of stone.<br />

  The evening primrose greets its light<br />
  With grace and joy: then opens up<br />
  The mimic moon within its cup.<br />
  Tall trees, as high as Babel tower,<br />
  Throw down their shadows to the flower&mdash;<br />
  Shadows that shiver&mdash;seem to see<br />
  An ending to infinity.<br />

  The Pagan Pan has now unbent<br />
  And stoops to sniff the night-stock scent<br />
  That brings a memory sad and old,<br />
  When he was young, and free, and bold,<br />
  To play his pipe in forests black,<br />
  Or follow in some goatherd's track<br />
  Who, fill'd with panic fear, then flees<br />
  Through all the terror-threatening trees.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Huge silver moths, like ghosts of flowers,<br />
  Hover about the warm dark bowers,<br />
  And wait to breathe the lime-tree scent<br />
  That perfum'd many a compliment<br />
  Address'd to beauties young and gay,<br />
  Their faces powdered by the ray<br />
  Of that same moon that looks upon<br />
  Their dreary lichen-cover'd tomb.<br />
  The dryads throw their water wide<br />
  And strive to stem the surging tide<br />
  That dashes up the fountain base,<br />
  Hoping to catch the moon's pale face&mdash;<br />
  A game now played without a score<br />
  For three good centuries or more.<br />
  And all the earth smells warm and sweet<br />
  &mdash;A fitting place for fairy feet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But now a figure white and frail<br />
  Leaps out into the moonlight pale.<br />
  From wakeful thoughts, old age and grief,<br />
  He finds in this strange world relief.<br />
  Yet all the shadow, scent and sound,<br />
  Poor Pierrot's mind do sad confound.<br />
  Watch how he dances to the moon<br />
  While singing some faint fragrant tune!<br />

<p class="poem">
  But Pierrot now is tired and sad<br />
  &mdash;Remembers all the evenings mad<br />
  He spent with that fantastic band<br />
  So gaily wand'ring o'er the land.<br />
  They all are dead&mdash;and at an end,<br />
  And he is left without a friend.<br />
  For tho' the hours can pass away,<br />
  Poor Pierrot still must grieve and stay.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Upon the dewy grass he lies:<br />
  The perfumes stir strange memories.<br />
  Once more he hears a laughing cry<br />
  That brings great tear-drops to his eye.<br />
  That step&mdash;that look&mdash;that voice&mdash;that smile.<br />
  Ah! they've been buried a long while!<br />
  And who's the man in pantaloons,<br />
  And he who sings such festive tunes?<br />
  Why, it's that laughing man of sin,<br />
  That roguish rascal Harlequin!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Forgiving Pierrot hides his head<br />
  Deep in the grass and mourns the dead;<br />
  Forgetting all the pranks they play'd,<br />
  And how he was himself betray'd.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The butterfly lives but one day,<br />
  But Pierrot still seems doom'd to stay.<br />

  All the dim terrors dwelling far below,<br />

  The wail forlorn of dogs that mourn for men&mdash;<br />
  A shuffling footfall on a creaking board,<br />
  The handle of a door that shakes and turns&mdash;<br />
  A door that opens slightly, not enough:<br />
  The rustling sigh of silk along a floor,<br />
  The knowledge of being watched by one long dead,<br />
  By something that is outside Nature's pale.<br />
  The unheard sounds that haunt an ancient house:<br />
  The feel of one who listens in the dark,<br />
  Listens to that which happened long ago,<br />
  Or what will happen after we are dust.<br />
  The awful waiting for a near event,<br />
  Or for a crash to rend the silence deep<br />
  Enveloping a house that always waits&mdash;<br />
  A house that whispers to itself and weeps.<br />
  The murmur of the yew, or woodland cries,<br />
  A sombre note of music on the breeze;<br />
  A shudder from the ivy that entwines<br />
  The horror that is felt within its grip.<br />
  The sound of prowling things that walk abroad,<br />
  The nauseous flapping of Night's bat-like wings&mdash;<br />
  These are the signs the gods have given us<br />
  To know the limit of our days and powers.<br />

  PROGRESS<br />

  The city's heat is like a leaden pall&mdash;<br />
  Its lowered lamps glow in the midnight air<br />
  Like mammoth orange-moths that flit and flare<br />
  Through the dark tapestry of night.  The tall<br />
  Black houses crush the creeping beggars down,<br />
  Who walk beneath and think of breezes cool,<br />
  Of silver bodies bathing in a pool,<br />
  Or trees that whisper in some far, small town<br />
  Whose quiet nursed them, when they thought that gold<br />
  Was merely metal, not a grave of mould<br />
  In which men bury all that's fine and fair.<br />
  When they could chase the jewelled butterfly<br />
  Through the green bracken-scented lanes, or sigh<br />
  For all the future held so rich and rare;<br />
  When, though they knew it not, their baby cries<br />
  Were lovely as the jewelled butterflies.<br />

  THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I lay awake in that dim room of fear<br />
  Which seemed to hold the essence of the night,<br />
  Clutched in the grip of its tall sentient walls:<br />
  Dark walls and high, that stretch for ever up&mdash;<br />
  Up to the darkness, vague and menacing,<br />
  As if no light could ever penetrate<br />
  That mist of shadows, only cast a gloom<br />
  More cavernous upon the atmosphere<br />
  That seems to thicken into cloudy shapes,<br />
  Substantiate&mdash;then disappear and die.<br />
  And all the room is full of whisperings;<br />
  Of moving things that hope I do not heed;<br />
  And sudden gusts of wind blow cold upon<br />
  My head, lifting the heavy mantle of the air,<br />
  Revealing for an instant some vague thought<br />
  Snatched from the haunting lumberland of dreams.<br />
  Far in the distance, from the open night,<br />
  Sounds an insistent hooting from the wood;<br />
  The owl is calling to its kindred things.<br />
  The bat emits its sinful piercing note&mdash;<br />
  So high one cannot hear it, only feel<br />
  The rhythm beat within the shrinking ear.<br />
  A faint breeze blows in from the countryside,<br />
  Rustling the curtains with the forest's breath,<br />
  Stirring the grass of many an unknown tomb,<br />
  Some new&mdash;some immemorably old,<br />
  Whose dwellers never heard an owl at night,<br />
  Only the reptile sounds and beating wings<br />
  Of some forefather of that bird of night&mdash;<br />
  Some flapping scaly monster with huge wings.<br />
  Then, sudden, through the rustling of the room<br />
  Silence shrills out its startling trumpet call<br />
  Of terror, and the house is frozen still.<br />
  Despair dropp'd down like rain upon my heart,<br />
  Catching my breath and clutching at my throat.<br />
  Fear magnified my senses, and my brain<br />
  Could hear beyond the threshold of this world.<br />
  Then through the threatening silence of the house,<br />
  The silent waiting for the coming play&mdash;<br />
  There came that halting well-remembered tread,<br />
  The dreadful limp, and dragging of the feet,<br />
  That cruel sin-white face looked through the door!<br />
  And in my scream&mdash;that rent the trembling air,<br />
  Reaching the woods and tainting them with death,<br />
  Filling the fountain with strange ripplings<br />
  That make the moon's reflection but a mask<br />
  Like to that face of shame&mdash;my soul passed out&mdash;<br />
  Out of my ashen lips, to find its end.<br />

  Each tortuous lane and slumb'ring stone-bound square<br />

  There by the railings, where the women pace<br />

  Racking each wearied soul with lost desires,<br />
  And&mdash;cruelty more subtle&mdash;he contrives<br />
  With aching memories of love's first fires<br />
  To tune their hearts up to a different key.<br />

  Then slowly drips on to the woods that sigh<br />
  For their past vivid vernal ecstasy.<br />
  The branches and the leaves let in the light<br />
  In patterns, woven 'gainst the paler sky<br />
  &mdash;Create mysterious Gothic tracery<br />
  Between those high dark pillars, that affright<br />
  Poor weary mortals who are wand'ring by.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Silence drips on the woods like sad faint rain<br />
  Making each frail tired sigh a sob of pain;<br />
  Each drop that falls, a hollow painted tear<br />
  Such as are shed by Pierrots when they fear<br />
  Black clouds may crush their silver lord to death.<br />
  The world is waxen; and the wind's least breath<br />
  Would make a hurricane of sound.  The earth<br />
  Smells of the hoarded sunlight that gave birth<br />
  To the gold-glowing radiance of that leaf<br />
  Which falls to bury from our sight its grief.<br />

  CLOWN PONDI<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  When youth and strength had changed my blood to fire<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every day passed long and glorious,<br />
  Another link in the eternal chain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life, I turned my love of luring and my sense<br />
  For all the unfathomable ways of God,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My burning sense for laughter and my joy<br />
  In crowds, in tumult, and in blazing lights,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make my fellows see these qualities.<br />
  Thus I became "Clown Pondi," and my fame<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew high in every theatre in the land.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I seem'd to draw fresh vigour from the crowds&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loving the sea of faces, eyes with tears,<br />
  And gaping mouths wide open&mdash;loosely hung;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acrid, opalescent haze of smoke,<br />
  Hanging above the auditorium.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over it the crowded galleries<br />
  That float far up, like painted prows of ships&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All overweighted and alive with men.<br />
  I loved the limelight, hard and white and strong,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throbbing music and the theatre's scent,<br />
  That artificial, paper, printed scent<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sweeps across the footlights to the stalls.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then was I pleased to strut about the stage,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With face dead white, and strangely purple nose&mdash;<br />
  Flamboyant in the garb of foolery&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run about too quickly&mdash;and fall down;<br />
  To make queer noises&mdash;inarticulate<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange sounds and oaths, the signal for my share<br />
  Of cackling laughter.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the years pass'd by<br />
  And&mdash;all unheeding&mdash;swept away my youth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till, one sad night, I heard a voice near-by:<br />
  "Ah!  Poor old man!  It's shocking they should laugh;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mock his bent legs, and poor old toothless jaws!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And then old-age rush'd down upon my head,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each sombre year roll'd past in solemn time;<br />
  In true perspective&mdash;to the jingling tune<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was my exit; and so near came death,<br />
  Holding a mirror to my ridicule,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That show'd each line beneath the smearing paint,<br />
  Each wrinkle underneath the dab of rouge,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That in my sudden hopelessness I wept.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I left the stage with dragging feet,<br />
  With body bent with age, and crouching low,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the applauding people pause and say,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who but Clown Pondi could amuse us so?"<br />

  SPRING HOURS<br />

<p class="poem">
  The air is silken&mdash;soft and dark&mdash;<br />
  Calm as the waters of some blue, far sea;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet as a youthful dream,<br />
  The trees stand cold and stark,<br />
  Yet full of the new life which makes each tree<br />
  To tremble with delight; sets free<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer rapture of the stream.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But now the clouds disperse and drift away,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splashing the woods with patches of pale light,<br />
  Sail off like silver ships, and then display<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling myriad blossoms of the night.<br />
</p>

  Ah!  It is worth full many a sun-gilt hour<br />

<p class="poem">
  Fate, malign dotard, weary from his days,<br />
  Too old for memory, yet craving pleasure,<br />
  Now finds the night too long and bitter cold<br />
  &mdash;Reminding him of death&mdash;the sun too hot.<br />
  The beauty of the universe he hates,<br />
  Yet stands regarding earthly carnivals:<br />
  The clatter and the clang of car and train,<br />
  The hurrying throng of homeward-going men,<br />
  The cries of children, colour of the streets,<br />
  Their whistling and their shouting and their joy,<br />
  The lights, the trees, the fanes and towers of churches,<br />
  Thanksgiving for the sun, the moon, the earth,<br />
  The labour, love, and laughter of our lives.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Their youth was fevered&mdash;passionate, quick to drain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last few pleasures from the cup of life<br />
  Before they turn'd to suck the dregs of pain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And end their young-old lives in mortal strife.<br />
  They paid the debts of many a hundred year<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of foolishness and riches in alloy.<br />
  They went to death; nor did they shed a tear<br />

  From within our pens,<br />
  Stout built,<br />
  We watch the sorrows of the world.<br />
  Imperturbably<br />
  We see the blood<br />
  Drip and ooze on to the walls.<br />
  Without a sigh<br />
  We watch our lambs<br />
  Stuffed and fattened for the slaughter....<br />

  We are the greatest sheep in the world;<br />

  With us they crash across continents.<br />

<p class="poem">
  We will not heed the herdsmen,<br />

  We gain nothing by it,<br />
  Therefore<br />
  It is a noble thing to do.<br />

  THE POET'S LAMENT.<br />

<p class="poem">

  My mind was a confusion of beauty.<br />
  Thoughts fell from it in riot<br />
  Of colour,<br />
  In wreaths and garlands of flowers and fruit...<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then the red dawn came<br />
  &mdash;And no thought came to me<br />
  Except anger<br />
  And bitter reproach.<br />
  God filled my mouth<br />
  With the burning pebbles of hatred,<br />
  And choked my soul<br />
  With a whirl-wind of fury.<br />
  He made my tongue<br />
  A flaming sword<br />
  To cut and wither<br />
  The white soft edges<br />
  Of their an√¶mic souls.<br />
  I ridiculed them,<br />
  I despised them,<br />
  I loathed them<br />
  ... But they had stolen my soul away.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Yes, they had stolen my soul from me.<br />
  My heart jumps up into my mouth<br />
  In fury;<br />
  They have stolen my soul away.<br />

  But we will wait,<br />
  And later words will come<br />
  &mdash;Words that in their burning flight<br />
  Shall scorch and flay,<br />
  Or flare like fireworks<br />
  Above their heads.<br />
  In those days my soul shall be restored to me<br />
  And they shall remember,<br />
  They shall remember!<br />

  Beauty where there was none before?<br />

  Under the surface&mdash;<br />

  To death in the circus of Flanders;<br />
  Of the skeletons that gather the fruit<br />
  From the ruined orchards of France;<br />
  And of those left to rot under an Eastern sun&mdash;<br />
  Whose dust mingles with the sand<br />

  You will have to drink a little more champagne,<br />
  And visit a theatre or perhaps a music-hall.<br />
  What you need (as you rightly say, my dear sir) is CHEERING-UP.<br />
  There you will see vastly funny sketches<br />
  Of your fighting countrymen;<br />
  And they will be represented<br />
  As those of whom you may be proud.<br />
  For they cannot talk English properly,<br />
  Or express themselves but by swearing;<br />
  Or perhaps they may be shown as drunk.<br />
  But they will all appear cheerful,<br />
  And you will be pleased;<br />
  And as you lurch amiably home, you will laugh,<br />
  And at each laugh<br />
  Another countryman will be dead!<br />

  Those blessed humble human words of doubt:<br />
  "My God!  My God! why hast Thou forsaken Me?"<br />

  Or a cheerful comment of some kind.<br />
  It was very unpleasant for all of us&mdash;<br />

  THE TRAP<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The world is young and green.<br />
  Its woods are golden beneath the May-time sun;<br />
  But within its trap of steel the rabbit plunges<br />
  Madly to and fro.<br />
  It will bleed to death<br />
  Slowly,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly,<br />
  Unless there is some escape.<br />
  Why will not someone release it?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And presently a kindly passer-by<br />
  Stoops down.<br />
  The rabbit's eye glints at him&mdash;<br />
  Gleaming from the impenetrable obscurity of its prison.<br />
  He stoops and lifts the catch<br />
  (He cannot hold it long, for the spring is heavy).<br />
  The rabbit could now be free,<br />
  But it does not move;<br />
  For from the darkness of its death-hutch<br />
  The world looks like another brightly baited trap.<br />
  So, remaining within its steel prison,<br />
  It argues thus:<br />
  "Perhaps I may bleed to death,<br />
  But it will probably take a long time,<br />
  And, at any rate,<br />
  I am secure<br />
  From the clever people outside.<br />
  Besides, if I did come out now<br />
  All the people who thought I was a lion<br />
  Would see, by the trap-mark on my leg,<br />
  That I am only an unfortunate rabbit,<br />
  And this might promote disloyalty among the children.<br />
  When the clamp closed on my leg<br />
  It was a ruse<br />
  To kill me.<br />
  Probably the lifting of it betrays the same purpose!<br />
  If I come out now<br />
  They will think they can trap rabbits<br />
  Whenever they like.<br />
  How do I know they will not snare me<br />
  Again next year?<br />
  Besides, it looks to me from here..."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But the catch drops down,<br />
  For the stranger is weary.<br />
  From within the hutch<br />
  A thin stream of blood<br />
  Trickles on to the grass<br />
  Outside,<br />
  And leaves a brown stain on its brightness.<br />
  But the dying rabbit is happy,<br />
  Saying:<br />
  "I knew it was only a trap!"<br />

  Other gods are lulled to sleep,<br />
  All the starving peoples die.<br />
  What is left to offer you?<br />
  Thou, O Sacred King of Death!<br />
  God of Blood and Lord of Guile,<br />
  Do not let us waste our breath,<br />
  Cast on us thy crimson smile.<br />
  Moloch, lord, we pray to thee,<br />
  Send at least one victory.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All the men in every land<br />
  Pray to thee through battle's din,<br />
  Swiftly now to show thy hand,<br />
  Pray that soon one side may win.<br />
  Under sea and in the sky,<br />
  Everywhere our children die;<br />
  Laughter, happiness and light<br />
  Perished in a single night.<br />
  In every land the heaving tides<br />
  Wash the sands a dreadful red,<br />
  In every land the tired sun hides<br />
  Under heaps and hills of dead.<br />
  In spite of all we've offered up<br />
  Must we drink and drain the cup?<br />
  Everywhere the dark floods rise,<br />
  Everywhere our hearts are torn.<br />
  Every day a new Christ dies,<br />
  Every day a devil's born.<br />
  Moloch, lord, we pray to thee,<br />
  Send at least one victory.<br />

  ARMCHAIR<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  If I were still of handsome middle-age<br />
  I should not govern yet, but still should hope<br />
  To help the prosecution of this war.<br />
  I'd talk and eat (though not eat wheaten bread),<br />
  I'd send my sons, if old enough, to France,<br />
  Or help to do my share in other ways.<br />
  All through the long spring evenings, when the sun<br />
  Pursues its primrose path towards the hills,<br />
  If fine, I'd plant potatoes on the lawn;<br />
  If wet, write anxious letters to the Press.<br />
  I'd give up wine and spirits, and with pride<br />
  Refuse to eat meat more than once a day,<br />
  And seek to rob the workers of their beer.<br />
  The only way to win a hard-fought war<br />
  Is to annoy the people in small ways,<br />
  Bully or patronise them, as you will!<br />
  I'd teach poor mothers, who have seven sons<br />
  &mdash;All fighting men of clean and sober life&mdash;<br />
  How to look after babies and to cook;<br />
  Teach them to save their money and invest;<br />
  Not to bring children up in luxury<br />
  &mdash;But do without a nursemaid in the house!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If I were old, or only seventy,<br />
  Then should I be a great man in his prime.<br />
  I should rule army corps; at my command<br />
  Men would rise up, salute me, and attack<br />
  &mdash;And die.  Or I might also govern men<br />
  By making speeches with my toothless jaws,<br />
  Chattering constantly; and men should say,<br />
  "One grand old man is still worth half his pay!"<br />
  That day I'd send my grandsons out to France<br />
  &mdash;And wish I'd got ten other ones to send<br />
  (One cannot sacrifice too much, I'd say).<br />
  Then would I make a noble toothless speech,<br />
  And all the listening Parliament would cheer.<br />
  "Gentlemen, we will never end this war<br />
  Till all the younger men with martial mien<br />
  Have entered capitals; never make peace<br />
  Till they are cripples, on one leg, or dead!"<br />
  Then would the Bishops all go mad with joy,<br />
  Cantuar, Ebor, and the other ones,<br />
  Be overwhelmed with pious ecstasy.<br />
  In thanking Him we'd got a Christian&mdash;<br />
  An Englishman&mdash;still worth his salt&mdash;to talk,<br />
  In every pulpit they would preach and prance;<br />
  And our great Church would work, as heretofore,<br />
  To bring this poor old nation to its knees.<br />
  Then we'd forbid all liberty, and make<br />
  Free speech a relic of our impious past;<br />
  And when this war is finished, when the world<br />
  Is torn and bleeding, cut and bruised to death,<br />
  Then I'd pronounce my peace terms&mdash;to the poor!<br />
  But as it is, I am not ninety yet,<br />
  And so must pay my reverence to these men&mdash;<br />
  These grand old men, who still can see and talk,<br />
  Who sacrifice each other's sons each day.<br />
  O Lord! let me be ninety yet, I pray.<br />
  Methuselah was quite a youngster when<br />
  He died.  Now, vainly weeping, we should say:<br />
  "Another great man perished in his prime!"<br />
  O let me govern, Lord, at ninety-nine!"<br />

  RAGTIME<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The lamps glow here and there, then echo down<br />
  The vast deserted vistas of the town&mdash;<br />
  Each light the echo'd note of some refrain<br />
  Repeated in the city's fevered brain.<br />
  Yet all is still, save when there wanders past<br />
  &mdash;Finding the silence of the night too long&mdash;<br />
  Some tattered wretch, who, from the night outcast,<br />
  Sings, with an aching heart, a comic song.<br />
  The vapid parrot-words flaunt through the night&mdash;<br />
  Silly and gay, yet terrible.  We know<br />
  Men sang these words in many a deadly fight,<br />
  And threw them&mdash;laughing&mdash;to a solemn foe;<br />
  Sang them where tattered houses stand up tall and stark,<br />
  And bullets whistle through the ruined street,<br />
  Where live men tread on dead men in the dark,<br />
  And skulls are sown in fields once sown with wheat.<br />
  Across the sea, where night is dark with blood<br />
  And rockets flash, and guns roar hoarse and deep,<br />
  They struggle through entanglements and mud,<br />
  They suffer wounds&mdash;and die&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here they sleep.<br />
  From far away the outcast's vacuous song<br />
  Re-echoes like the singing of a throng;<br />
  His dragging footfalls echo down the street,<br />
  And turn into a myriad marching feet.<br />

  PEACE CELEBRATION<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Now we can say of those who died unsung,<br />
  Unwept for, torn, "Thank God they were not blind<br />
  Or mad!  They've perished strong and young,<br />
  Missing the misery we elders find<br />
  In missing them."  With such a platitude<br />
  We try to cheer ourselves.  And for each life<br />
  Laid down for us, with duty well-imbued,<br />
  With song-on-lip, in splendid soldier strife&mdash;<br />
  For sailors, too, who willingly were sunk&mdash;<br />
  We'll shout "Hooray!"&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And get a little drunk.<br />

  THE NEXT WAR<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  The long war had ended.<br />
  Its miseries had grown faded.<br />
  Deaf men became difficult to talk to.<br />
  Heroes became bores.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Those alchemists<br />
  Who had converted blood into gold,<br />
  Had grown elderly.<br />
  But they held a meeting,<br />
  Saying,<br />
  "We think perhaps we ought<br />
  To put up tombs<br />
  Or erect altars<br />
  To those brave lads<br />
  Who were so willingly burnt,<br />
  Or blinded,<br />
  Or maimed,<br />
  Who lost all likeness to a living thing,<br />
  Or were blown to bleeding patches of flesh<br />
  For our sakes.<br />
  It would look well.<br />
  Or we might even educate the children."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But the richest of these wizards<br />
  Coughed gently;<br />
  And he said,<br />
  "I have always been to the front<br />
  &mdash;In private enterprise&mdash;<br />
  I yield in public spirit<br />
  To no man.<br />
  I think yours is a very good idea<br />
  &mdash;A capital idea&mdash;<br />
  And not too costly.<br />
  But it seems to me<br />
  That the cause for which we fought<br />
  Is again endangered.<br />
  What more fitting memorial for the fallen<br />
  Than that their children<br />
  Should fall for the same cause?"<br />
  Rushing eagerly into the street,<br />
  The kindly old gentlemen cried<br />
  To the young:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will you sacrifice<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through your lethargy<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What your fathers died to gain?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cause is in peril.<br />
  The world must be made safe for the young!"<br />
  And the children<br />
  Went....<br />
